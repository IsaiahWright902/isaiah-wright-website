                        Like a lot of devs, I love exploring new ideas and technologies by jumping into code.
                        The result? A ton of Git repos.
                        At one point, I had over 140â€”most of them tiny proof-of-concepts or half-baked experiments.

                        One day I decided to clean house... and hit a wall.
                        GitHub only lets you delete repos one at a time? Who has the time for that?

                <Grid item xs={12} >
                    <Typography>
                        So, I built a tool to fix it.
                        It lets you log in with GitHub SSO, fetch all your repositories, select the ones you no longer need, and delete them in bulk. Simple as that.

                        This was a super fun project to put together, and I'm excited to share it.
