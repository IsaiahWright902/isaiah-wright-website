## Check it out here! [isaiahwright.dev](https://isaiahwright.dev)
# Description
For my site I wanted to make a portfolio site that was interactive, something that let you play around with it. To do this I implemented features such as:

Ability to choose a prefered color that influences the sites UI.

Light and Dark mode that persists.

Searchable skills .

Easily scalable and maintainable componets for rapid changes.

This site will serve a future platform for me to play with technologies and ideas that make me excited. See tuned to watch it grow overtime!

# Technologies Used:
### Front End
Next.js, TypeScript, Redux, Redux Persist, MUI, React Hookform, Zod Validation

### Back End 
Sendgird Mail, Next API with future infrastrucutre for more features

### Unit Testing
Jest

### Deployment
Automated CI/CD pipeline using github actions that builds a Docker image, pushes it to Google Container Registry, and then it deploys it on Google Cloud Run.
